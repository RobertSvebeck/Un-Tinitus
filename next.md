Furthermore, while synthetic harmonic complex sounds (with little 
intrinsic listening appeal) were used for this experiment, they do not 
necessarily need to be the modulation carrier. The modulation could be 
applied across a range of natural or synthetic sounds that have sufficient 
high-frequency content. Importantly, the reaction and potential benefit 
from the sound sequences used in sound therapy can be individualistic, 
depending on the emotions elicited by the sounds (Searchfield et al., 
2017). Therefore, a potential next step could be to apply the modulation 
to already well-tolerated music/sound sequences that the participants 
enjoy, thus allowing for an even more personalised approach.Automated online sound therapy is feasible for longitudinal tinnitus 
treatment studies. Moreover, our novel cross-frequency de-correlating 
amplitude  and  phase-modulated  sounds  show  promise  in  reducing 
perceived tinnitus loudness. Once optimal parameters and efficacy are 
determined, the treatment can be made freely available on an unlimited 
scale to the tinnitus community, and iteratively improved by the low- 
cost-low-burden  running  of  large  automated  online  randomised 
controlled trials.
